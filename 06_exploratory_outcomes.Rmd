## Microbiome

Intervention effects on microbiome diversity measures

Combined arms:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap=""}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/forest_plot_microbiome_diversity.png")

```

Stratified arms:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap=""}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/forest_plot_microbiome_diversity_arm_strat.png")

```

Intervention effects on individual microbiome components

Combined arms:


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap=""}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/volcano_plot_microbiome.png")

```


Stratified arms:


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap=""}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/volcano_plot_microbiome_arm_strat.png")

```

## Proteomics

Note- proteomics were taken in a subset of mother-child dyads, and was only taken in the control arm of the Elicit trial, and so intervention effects were not estimatable.

No specific pattern of effects was noted, and the proportion of significant was consisten with false postives under a global null hypothesis.
