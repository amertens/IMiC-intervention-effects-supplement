# IMiC Intervention Effects – Online Supplement

This repository contains the source code, data processing scripts, and Bookdown configuration used to generate the **interactive online supplementary material** for the manuscript:

**“Nutritional interventions’ impacts on human milk: three trial analyses from low-resource settings”**

The supplement accompanies the main manuscript and provides complete analytical outputs, interactive visualizations, and detailed results that cannot be fully presented in a static article format.

The rendered supplement is available as an HTML website and is intended for online use.

## Purpose of this repository

This repository serves to:

- Generate an **interactive, web-based supplementary appendix** using Bookdown  
- Provide **transparent, reproducible analytical outputs** for all stages of the study  
- Host **interactive forest plots, volcano plots, trajectory analyses, and tables**  
- Document exploratory, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses referenced in the manuscript  

This repository is **not** intended to reproduce the main manuscript text itself, but rather to support and extend it.

## Supplement contents

The online supplement is organized into the following chapters:

1. **Baseline characteristics**  
   Maternal, infant, and household characteristics by study and intervention arm.

2. **Human milk distributions**  
   Interactive density plots and boxplots for all measured milk components.

3. **Infant growth analyses**  
   Intervention effects on infant anthropometry within the IMiC subsamples.

4. **Adjusted intervention effects**  
   Covariate-adjusted average treatment effects for primary and secondary milk outcomes.

5. **Unadjusted and unscaled analyses**  
   Descriptive contrasts and natural-scale effect estimates.

6. **Exploratory outcomes**  
   Milk microbiome, proteomics, and untargeted metabolomics analyses.

7. **Subgroup analyses**  
   Stratified analyses by maternal BMI and other prespecified factors.

8. **Sensitivity analyses**  
   Robustness checks and alternative modeling specifications.

9. **Trajectory analyses**  
   Longitudinal analyses of visit-to-visit changes in milk composition.
