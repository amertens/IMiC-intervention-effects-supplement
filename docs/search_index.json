"],["study-baseline-characteristics-1.html", "Chapter 2 Study Baseline Characteristics 2.1 Misame 2.2 Mumta 2.3 Elicit", " Chapter 2 Study Baseline Characteristics This chapter summarizes baseline maternal, infant, and household characteristics for the IMiC subsamples drawn from the three randomized trials included in the intervention effects analysis: MISAME-III (Burkina Faso), Mumta-LW (Pakistan), and ELICIT (Tanzania). Baseline characteristics are presented separately by study and stratified by randomized intervention arm, using the earliest available postnatal visit corresponding to milk sample collection in each trial. Tables report key demographic, anthropometric, socioeconomic, and household variables that are plausibly associated with maternal nutritional status, breastfeeding context, or infant outcomes, including infant sex, maternal age, education, height, parity, household composition, housing characteristics, water source, season and location of delivery, household wealth index, and food security. These variables were harmonized across studies as part of the IMiC data curation process and are described in detail in the Supplementary Methods. The purpose of this chapter is descriptive: to characterize the analytic populations contributing milk samples in each trial and to assess baseline balance across intervention arms following randomization. No statistical tests of between-arm differences are performed here, consistent with best practices for randomized trials. These tables provide contextual information for interpreting intervention effect estimates presented in subsequent chapters. 2.1 Misame Control(N=73) BEP/BEP(N=66) BEP/IFA(N=56) IFA/BEP(N=81)

composition across studies, visits, and randomized intervention arms. The purpose of these analyses is to characterize the empirical distributions of milk components prior to modeling intervention effects and to provide context for the magnitude, variability, and baseline heterogeneity of milk constituents across settings. Interactive density plots and boxplots are provided for all measured milk components, including macronutrients, micronutrients, B-vitamins, human milk oligosaccharides, targeted metabolites, and other analytes defined in the IMiC outcome framework. Distributions are stratified by study, milk collection visit, and intervention arm, allowing visualization of between-site differences, within-site variability, and potential shifts in central tendency or dispersion associated with supplementation. These figures are descriptive only. No covariate adjustment, hypothesis testing, or multiple-comparison correction is applied in this chapter. Apparent differences between arms or visits should therefore be interpreted as exploratory and may reflect baseline differences, sampling variability, or physiological variation across lactation, rather than causal intervention effects. Formal estimates of intervention effects are presented in subsequent chapters using prespecified statistical models. 3.1 Histograms of milk components Unstratified histograms of milk component distributions.

Results are shown as forest plots stratified by study and milk collection visit and are intended to facilitate clinical and biological interpretation of effect magnitudes. Average treatment effects (ATEs) are estimated using targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) and are displayed on the natural scale of each milk component (for example, g/100 mL, mg/L, or µg/L, depending on the analyte). As in other chapters, results are first presented for pooled postnatal nutritional intervention arms to improve precision, followed by estimates for each randomized intervention arm contrasted with the corresponding control arm. False-discovery rate (FDR) correction is applied within outcome groups, and effects remaining significant after correction are indicated by solid symbols in the forest plots. Because milk components differ substantially in scale and variability, these unscaled plots are not intended for cross-component comparison. Instead, they complement the standardized analyses by providing interpretable estimates of absolute change in milk composition attributable to intervention exposure. Primary inference regarding the presence and consistency of intervention effects is based on the standardized, covariate-adjusted analyses presented in earlier chapters, while this chapter supports contextualization of those findings in biologically meaningful units. 6.0.0.1 Macronutrients - combined arms ## Adding missing grouping variables: `measure` 6.0.0.2 Macronutrients - stratified arms ## Adding missing grouping variables: `measure` 6.0.0.3 Micronutrients - combined arms ## Adding missing grouping variables: `measure` 6.0.0.4 Micronutrients - stratified arms 6.0.0.5 B-vitamins - combined arms ## Adding missing grouping variables: `measure` 6.0.0.6 B-vitamins - stratified arms 6.0.0.7 HMOs - combined arms ## Adding missing grouping variables: `measure` 6.0.0.8 HMOs - stratified arms 6.0.0.9 Bioactives - combined arms ## Adding missing grouping variables: `measure` 6.0.0.10 Bioactives - stratified arms "],["exploratory-outcomes-microbiome-proteomics-and-untargeted-metabolomics.html", "Chapter 7 Exploratory Outcomes: Microbiome, Proteomics, and Untargeted Metabolomics 7.1 Microbiome 7.2 Proteomics 7.3 Untargeted Metabolomics", " Chapter 7 Exploratory Outcomes: Microbiome, Proteomics, and Untargeted Metabolomics This chapter presents exploratory analyses of human milk components that were not designated as primary or secondary outcomes, including the milk microbiome, untargeted proteomics, and untargeted metabolomics. These analyses are intended to provide a comprehensive view of potential intervention-related signals across high-dimensional data modalities and to support hypothesis generation. All results in this chapter should be interpreted cautiously. Estimates are subject to substantial multiple-testing burden, variable measurement error, and, in some cases, limited sample size or incomplete intervention contrasts. Formal inference and primary conclusions are therefore based on prespecified outcomes presented in earlier chapters. 7.1 Microbiome 7.1.1 Intervention effects on microbiome diversity This section summarizes intervention effects on milk microbiome alpha diversity metrics. Forest plots display average treatment effect estimates for standard diversity measures, stratified by study and milk collection visit. Results are shown first for pooled postnatal nutritional intervention arms, followed by arm-stratified contrasts against the control condition. Across studies and visits, no consistent intervention-related changes in microbiome diversity were observed. The magnitude and direction of estimated effects varied across time points and studies, and confidence intervals generally overlapped the null, consistent with limited sensitivity of milk microbiome diversity to maternal nutritional supplementation. 7.1.1.1 Combined arms: 7.1.1.2 Stratified arms: 7.1.2 Intervention effects on individual microbial features Volcano plots summarize intervention effects on individual microbial taxa and sequence variants. Results are shown for pooled intervention arms and for arm-stratified contrasts. Across analyses, the distribution of effect estimates and p-values was consistent with a global null hypothesis, with no enrichment of statistically significant features beyond what would be expected by chance after accounting for multiple testing. No taxa exhibited reproducible intervention-associated shifts across studies or visits. 7.1.2.1 Combined arms: 7.1.2.2 Stratified arms: 7.2 Proteomics Untargeted proteomic analyses were conducted in a subset of motherinfant dyads and were subject to important design constraints. Proteomics data were available for a limited number of samples and, in the ELICIT trial, were collected only in the control arm. As a result, formal estimation of randomized intervention effects was not possible for this modality. Volcano plots are presented for completeness and descriptive purposes only. Across both pooled and arm-stratified visualizations, the proportion of nominally significant protein-level associations was consistent with false positives expected under a global null distribution. No coherent pattern of protein-level changes attributable to intervention exposure was observed. 7.2.0.1 Combined-arms 7.2.0.2 Arm-stratified 7.3 Untargeted Metabolomics This section summarizes exploratory intervention effects on untargeted milk metabolites. Volcano plots display effect estimates and significance levels for thousands of metabolite features, aggregated across studies and visits. Compared with the microbiome and proteomics analyses, untargeted metabolomics exhibited a higher density of features with nominal evidence of intervention association. However, signals were heterogeneous across studies and time points, and only a small fraction of features remained significant after correction for multiple testing. These results indicate the presence of weak, distributed metabolic shifts rather than large, discrete intervention effects on individual metabolites. Pathway-level summaries and targeted metabolite analyses, which provide a more interpretable and biologically coherent view of metabolic changes, are presented elsewhere in the supplement and in the main manuscript. "],["subgroup-analyses-stratified-by-maternal-bmi-1.html", "Chapter 8 Subgroup analyses stratified by maternal BMI", " Chapter 8 Subgroup analyses stratified by maternal BMI This chapter presents subgroup analyses evaluating whether the effects of maternal nutritional interventions on human milk components differed by maternal nutritional status at baseline, operationalized using maternal body mass index (BMI). Maternal BMI was dichotomized a priori into underweight (BMI  18.5 kg/m²) and normal or overweight (BMI &gt; 18.5 kg/m²) categories, consistent with international definitions and the distribution of BMI across studies. Analyses were conducted separately within each BMI stratum using the same targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) framework as in the primary adjusted analyses, including adjustment for prespecified baseline prognostic covariates and standardization of outcomes. Average treatment effects were estimated within strata for primary outcomes (macronutrients, micronutrients, and B-vitamins), secondary outcomes (HMOs and bioactive proteins), and tertiary outcomes (targeted metabolites). To formally assess effect heterogeneity, interaction p-values were computed for each milk component by comparing stratum-specific treatment effect estimates. Specifically, differences in estimated average treatment effects between BMI strata were evaluated using a Wald-type test based on the difference in estimates scaled by the pooled standard error. These interaction p-values are reported alongside stratum-specific estimates to facilitate assessment of potential effect modification. Forest plots summarize BMI-stratified treatment effects for selected outcome groups, and accompanying tables report point estimates, confidence intervals, and interaction p-values for all analyzed components. Across studies, visits, and outcome domains, there was no consistent evidence of effect modification by maternal BMI. Where stratum-specific estimates differed in magnitude or direction, confidence intervals were typically wide and interaction tests were not statistically significant after accounting for multiplicity and limited subgroup sample sizes. These subgroup analyses were conducted as secondary, exploratory assessments of heterogeneity and were not powered to detect modest interaction effects. Consequently, they should be interpreted cautiously. Primary inference regarding intervention effects is based on pooled analyses presented in earlier chapters, with BMI-stratified results serving to assess robustness of findings across maternal nutritional status categories and to inform future hypothesis generation rather than definitive conclusions about effect modification.

Unlike the cross-sectional analyses presented elsewhere in the supplement, these analyses focus on changes over time in milk components within the same motherinfant dyads. For each milk component, trajectories were constructed by transforming the raw concentration measurements into visit-to-visit differences, defined as the difference between a given visit and the immediately preceding visit within each mother. This approach isolates temporal changes in milk composition and evaluates whether the magnitude or direction of those changes differed by intervention arm. Baseline visits without a prior observation were excluded from the trajectory analyses. Trajectory-specific intervention effects were estimated using targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), with adjustment for the same prespecified baseline prognostic covariates used in the primary adjusted analyses. Outcomes were standardized prior to estimation to facilitate comparability across components with different measurement scales. Analyses were conducted separately by study and visit interval, and intervention arms were pooled where appropriate to improve statistical efficiency. Results are summarized using volcano plots for primary outcomes (macronutrients, micronutrients, and B-vitamins), secondary outcomes (HMOs and bioactive proteins), and tertiary outcomes (targeted metabolites). These plots display estimated intervention effects on visit-to-visit changes alongside corresponding statistical significance after false-discovery rate (FDR) correction, highlighting milk components for which supplementation was associated with altered temporal trajectories rather than static differences at a single visit. Accompanying tables provide full numerical results for trajectory effects, including adjusted estimates, confidence intervals, and multiplicity-adjusted p-values for both pooled intervention contrasts and combined-arm analyses. In addition, trajectory line plots visualize mean milk component concentrations over time by intervention arm for selected outcomes, linking the modeled trajectory effects to observed longitudinal patterns. These trajectory analyses are exploratory and should be interpreted cautiously. Power to detect trajectory-specific intervention effects is limited by the number of repeated measurements per participant and by sample size within individual studies and visit intervals. Accordingly, primary inference regarding intervention effects is based on cross-sectional adjusted analyses at prespecified visits, with trajectory analyses serving to contextualize those findings and to explore whether supplementation is associated with consistent, delayed, or cumulative changes in milk composition across early lactation. 9.1 Tables ## Warning in instance$preRenderHook(instance): It seems your data is too big for client-side ## DataTables.

Line plots display mean milk component levels across successive visits, aggregated within biologically defined component categories (for example, macronutrients, B-vitamins, HMOs, amino acids, and other metabolite classes), and stratified by randomized intervention arm. For each study separately, milk component measurements were first aligned to study-specific visit schedules and harmonized across visits. Individual milk components were then grouped into predefined analytical categories. Within each study, visit, and intervention arm, component values were averaged across all available biomarkers within a category to produce category-level summaries. Plots are shown both on a standardized scale (z-scored within study and visit) to facilitate comparison of temporal patterns across categories with different units and variances, and on the original measurement scale to preserve interpretability of absolute concentrations. ## $p_misame_scaled ## ## $p_elicit_scaled ## ## $p_vital_scaled ## ## $p_misame_unscaled ## ## $p_misame_unscaled ## ## $p_vital_unscaled "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
