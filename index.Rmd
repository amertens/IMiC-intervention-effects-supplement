# Supplementary Material for IMiC Intervention Effects Manuscript

This online supplementary appendix provides the complete analytical outputs supporting the manuscript  
**“The impact of nutritional interventions on human milk in low resource settings: findings from the International Milk Composition (IMiC) Consortium.”**  


## Organization of the Online Supplement

### Study Baseline Characteristics

  Detailed maternal, infant, and household characteristics for the IMiC subsamples across trials, including comparisons with parent trial populations and baseline balance across intervention arms.

### Human Milk Component Distributions

  Unadjusted distributions of all measured human milk components, including macronutrients, micronutrients, B-vitamins, HMOs, targeted metabolites, proteins, and microbiome features, stratified by study and visit where applicable.

### Adjusted Intervention Effects on Individual Milk Components

  Covariate-adjusted average treatment effect estimates for primary outcomes (macronutrients and micronutrients), with false-discovery rate correction applied by outcome group.


### Unadjusted Intervention Effects on Individual Milk Components
  Corresponding unadjusted estimates for all milk components.

### Unscaled Intervention Effects on Individual Milk Components

  Corresponding adjusted, but unscaled estimates for all milk components, using the raw concentration values without Z-scoring for comparison across milk components.

### Targeted and Exploratory Milk Components

  Results for tertiary and exploratory outcomes, including targeted metabolomics, untargeted metabolomics, untargeted proteomics, and milk microbiome analyses, with pathway- and set-level summaries.

### Subgroup analyses stratified by maternal BMI

  Effect modification analyses stratified by maternal BMI category (underweight vs not)


### Trajectory analyses of human milk component change across lactation

  Visualization of longitudinal trajectories of selected milk components across lactation by study and intervention arm.
